## Usage

To see this application in action use the following link: https://shaneleejohnson.github.io/Weather-Forecast/

This application uses the OpenWeatherMaps API to grab current and 5-day future forecast weather data for a city that the user searches for. Once you type in a city name, click on the search button and you will see the current weather data including the city name, current date, an icon indicating the weather (sunny, cloudy, etc.), the current temperature, windspeed, and humidity. You will also see the date, weather icon, temperature, windspeed, and humidity for the next five days. Whenever you search a city, a button is created for that city that you can click on to retrieve weather data for that city without having to do another search. Each city that you search will be saved as a button if a button for that city doesn't already exist. The city buttons are saved locally and will stay even after refreshing the page.
